# TIP21-ISBOSPRC-Semantic-Planar-Region-Segmentation-Dataset
This is the repository containing the dataset for the task of Semantic Planar Region
Segmentation proposed in the paper Image Stitching Based On Semantic Planar Region
Consensus (abbreviated as ISBOSPRC). 
- The dataset images are from ADE20k and can be accessed similarly as in this [repository] 
  (https://www.github.com/CSAILVision/semantic-segmentation-pytorch). Please use training_sprs.odgt 
  and validation_sprs.odgt for We manually relabel
  the images to contain the semantic planar region segmentation information.
